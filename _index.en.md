{{< text2 TITLE="Why alpha?">}}
If you're still here, I hope that *alpha* has sparked your curiosity.

I could keep going and bombard you with fancy stats, flipping headings, endless parallax effects, smooth fade-ins, and scrolling text from every direction—all showcasing the "mightiness" of alpha's strengths and "uniqueness".

But that’s not what alpha is about.
And honestly, I’m not here to sell, convince, or influence you.

Like nearly every theme out there, Alpha is packed with almost every functionality a static website might need.
I didn’t reinvent the wheel, and I’m not claiming to have created a better one.

Instead, here’s what I believe:
1. I’ve made a *"wheel"* that’s **easy to use** for everyone, creators and visitors alike. And that’s what matters most to me.
2. I designed alpha for long, **text-heavy** journeys, because some stories and ideas deserve space to breathe and unfold.

And that's my honest perspective on why to choose alpha.
