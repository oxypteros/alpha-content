Google recommends HTML file upload as the primary verification method because:

More Reliable – The file remains in place even if your meta tags change.
Independent of CMS/Theme – Works regardless of how your site is built (Hugo, WordPress, custom HTML, etc.).
Less Affected by Caching/CDNs – Some caching settings or CDNs might strip meta tags, but an HTML file is usually preserved.
Which Is Better?
Use HTML File Upload if you have direct control over your site’s files and deployments.
Use Meta Tag if you don’t have file access or prefer to manage verification through the theme.
For Cloudflare Pages, both methods work, but HTML file upload might be easier to maintain.
