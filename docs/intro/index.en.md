The hardest part of a 1000km journey is the first step. Likewise, the hardest part of any series, whether it’s a book, a TV show, or a documentation, is the first chapter. The first episode.
We struggled with many “difficult” decisions while creating Alpha, but one of the biggest was:

## Where Should We Host the Docs?
*"Alpha is not designed for documentation".*   
It’s a theme built for stories, narrations, serialized content. Even a simple recipe post might look out of place, imagine an entire documentation site!

*“But a documentation is a serialized content too, no?”*
What better way to showcase Alpha’s capabilities than by documenting Alpha itself? Even if it wasn’t built for documentation, in the end, text is text, and we’re here to write.
